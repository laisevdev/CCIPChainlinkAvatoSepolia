Project Description:

 Smart Contract built using Chainlink's Oracle services, the CCIP, where we can exchange assets between different networks, in this case from Avalanche's TestNet to Ethereum's Sepolia TestNet.

 How to run this project:

  You can copy the smart contract from here and paste it into Remix IDE and deploy it using Chainlink and Avalanche TestNet services. 
  Or you can copy the address of this Contract: 0x28A2be4039f64FCb22dF7BBA588e99f2Dfb7Ba2d, go to Remix IDE, and paste it into "At Address". Now you can interact with it.
